# Golden Heavy Block 1 & 2 `Retired`

### Block 1
Yep, this is Gray Heavy predecessor. I created it just after i bought Spaceflight Simulator expansion pack, ignore the fact that ~~i use titan engine for second stage~~. A very poorly made rocket, core stage will run out of fuel literally 5 seconds after booster sep.

- *Designed for Normal Mode*
- **Max Payload:** 122 Tons
- **Fairing Dimensions:** 5 x 14 Meters

### Block 2
A much better version of it, only for me to never use launch any payload on this guy.

- **Max Payload:** 275 Tons
- **Fairing Dimensions:** 5 x 17.5 Meters
